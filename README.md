# Build-20-Real-World-Apps-with-Python-Including-AI-Agents-with-LangChain.

We'll build 20 different apps throughout the repo, each focusing on a specific area of Python programming. These include:

    Automation scripts

    Web applications

    APIs

    Data science tools

    Web scraping programs

    Desktop apps with a graphical interface

    AI agents using Python and LangChain

Each app is developed step by step, with clear explanations along the way. You don't need any prior programming experience to follow the course. 
The only requirement is that you’re willing to follow along and write code as you go.
